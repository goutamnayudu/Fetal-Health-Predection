**Fetal Health Prediction Using Machine Learning**
This project aims to predict fetal health conditions using machine learning techniques. The model classifies fetal health into three categories: normal, suspect, and pathological, based on key medical attributes derived from CTG (Cardiotocography) data.

**Features**
Dataset: Utilized a publicly available CTG dataset for training and evaluation.
Algorithms: Implemented various machine learning models, with performance metrics compared to identify the best approach.
User Interface: Includes a clean and user-friendly web interface for input and prediction.
Performance: Achieved high accuracy and precision in classification.
**Tech Stack**
Languages: Python
Libraries: Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
Web Interface: HTML, CSS (for demonstration purposes)
Documentation: IEEE publication in progress
**How to Use**
Clone the repository.
Run the application using the provided scripts.
Upload input data (CTG attributes) to predict fetal health.
**Future Scope**
Deploying the model as a full-stack web application.
Extending functionality with additional predictive insights.
